# Predator-Prey Model with Numerical Methods and Ecological Factors

This project models the evolution of predators and prey within an ecosystem by applying the **Lotka-Volterra equations** and enhancing them to include pollution effects and resource limitations. We solved and analyzed the systems numerically using **Euler's method** in **MATLAB**.

## üìö Conclusion

In this project, we explored the dynamics of predator-prey interactions using the **Lotka-Volterra model**, extending it by considering ecological factors such as pollution and resource limitations. Through the analysis of the simplified model, we demonstrated the characteristic oscillatory behavior of predator-prey systems ‚Äî highlighting how prey populations can grow exponentially in the absence of predators and how predator populations decline without sufficient prey.

By employing **Euler's explicit method** for numerical simulations, we visualized different population dynamics under varying initial conditions and parameters. Our results illustrated the critical role of environmental factors in shaping the stability and behavior of ecological systems.

Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of considering both biological interactions and environmental constraints in ecological modeling. It lays a solid foundation for future research into more complex systems that incorporate additional real-world factors like habitat loss, climate change, and human interventions.
